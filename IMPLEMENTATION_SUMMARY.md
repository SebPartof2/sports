# NFL Broadcast Information Feature - Summary

## Overview
This PR adds broadcasting information for NFL games, extending the existing MLB broadcast feature to support the NFL league.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Core API Changes

#### `lib/api.ts`
- Added shared `Broadcast` interface that works for both MLB and NFL
- Added `broadcasts?: Broadcast[]` field to the `Game` interface
- Interface supports both MLB-specific fields (from MLB Stats API) and NFL-specific fields (from ESPN API)

#### `lib/nfl-api.ts`
- Added `fetchNFLBroadcastsByDate(date: string)` function
- Fetches broadcast data from ESPN NFL API
- Maps ESPN broadcast structure to shared Broadcast interface
- Returns dictionary of game IDs to Broadcast arrays

### 2. UI Changes

#### `app/page.tsx`
- Updated `BroadcastsTab` component to accept `league` parameter
- Added conditional logic to fetch broadcasts based on league (MLB or NFL)
- Updated tab visibility to show for both MLB and NFL: `(selectedLeague === 'mlb' || selectedLeague === 'nfl')`
- Updated styling to use league-specific colors (blue for NFL, mlb-blue for MLB)
- Enhanced fallback handling for missing broadcast data fields
- Made language display optional (defaults to 'EN' if not provided)

### 3. Configuration Updates

#### `lib/broadcast-config.ts`
- Added NFL fallback logo path: `nfl: '/logos/broadcasts/generic/NFLb.png'`
- Updated `getBroadcastLogo()` to support NFL sport parameter

#### `public/logos/broadcasts/generic/`
- Added `NFLb.png` - fallback logo for NFL broadcasts
- Added `NFLb-placeholder.md` - documentation for NFL broadcast logos

### 4. Documentation

#### `NFL_BROADCAST_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- Comprehensive documentation of the NFL broadcast feature
- Details on API integration with ESPN
- Data mapping explanations
- Usage instructions and testing notes

#### `test-nfl-broadcasts.js`
- Manual test plan for validating the implementation
- Test scenarios and expected behaviors
- Integration test steps

## Key Features

✅ **ESPN API Integration**: Fetches NFL broadcast data from ESPN's public API
✅ **Shared Interface**: Broadcast interface works for both MLB and NFL
✅ **Responsive UI**: Same responsive grid layout (1-4 columns) as MLB
✅ **League-Specific Styling**: Colors and fallback logos adapt to the league
✅ **Graceful Fallbacks**: Handles missing data fields safely
✅ **National/Local Markets**: Displays broadcast market information
✅ **TV/Radio Grouping**: Separates TV and radio broadcasts into sections

## API Data Sources

### MLB
- **API**: MLB Stats API
- **Endpoint**: `https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/schedule?sportId=1&date=YYYY-MM-DD&hydrate=broadcasts`
- **Data Location**: `dates[0].games[].broadcasts[]`

### NFL
- **API**: ESPN NFL API
- **Endpoint**: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard?dates=YYYYMMDD`
- **Data Location**: `events[].competitions[0].broadcasts[]`

## Testing

### Completed
✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
✅ Code structure reviewed and validated
✅ Git changes committed successfully

### Requires Network Access (Manual Testing)
⏳ Test with live NFL games
⏳ Verify ESPN API broadcast data retrieval
⏳ Validate UI display with real NFL broadcasts
⏳ Test fallback logo loading

## Usage Example

```typescript
// Fetch NFL broadcasts for a specific date
import { fetchNFLBroadcastsByDate } from './lib/nfl-api'

const broadcasts = await fetchNFLBroadcastsByDate('2024-01-14')
// Returns:
// {
//   "401547438": [
//     {
//       name: "CBS",
//       type: "TV",
//       isNational: true,
//       callSign: "CBS",
//       market: "National",
//       language: "en"
//     }
//   ]
// }
```

## Next Steps

1. **Add Network Logos**: Add actual logo files for NFL broadcast networks (CBS, FOX, NBC, ESPN, NFL Network, etc.) to `/public/logos/broadcasts/tv/`
2. **Test with Live Data**: Test during NFL season with live games to validate API integration
3. **Streaming Services**: Consider adding logos for streaming services (Prime Video, Peacock, etc.)
4. **Enhance Filtering**: Add filters for national vs local broadcasts

## Backwards Compatibility

✅ All existing MLB functionality remains unchanged
✅ No breaking changes to existing components
✅ Shared Broadcast interface is backwards compatible with MLB implementation

## Implementation Notes

- The implementation follows the same pattern as the existing MLB broadcast feature
- Code reuses the BroadcastsTab component with minimal modifications
- ESPN API provides broadcast data in a slightly different format than MLB Stats API, but the mapping handles this gracefully
- All optional fields are safely handled with fallbacks
- The implementation is defensive against missing or malformed API data
