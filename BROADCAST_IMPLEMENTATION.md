# MLB Broadcast Feature Implementation

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Core Implementation
- ✅ Added `Broadcast` interface to `lib/mlb-api.ts`
- ✅ Added `fetchMLBBroadcastsByDate()` function to fetch broadcast data
- ✅ Updated `Game` interface to include `broadcasts?: Broadcast[]`
- ✅ Added "Broadcasts" tab to the game detail modal (MLB only)

### 2. UI Improvements
- ✅ **Duplicate Removal**: Filters out duplicate broadcasts (same name + callSign)
- ✅ **Larger Tiles**: Implemented responsive grid with larger, card-style tiles
- ✅ **Logo Placeholders**: 64x64px logo containers with fallback text
- ✅ **Better Layout**: Clean, modern design with proper spacing and typography
- ✅ **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges for media state and availability

### 3. Configuration System
- ✅ Created `/public/logos/broadcasts/` directory structure:
  - `tv/` - Television network logos
  - `radio/` - Radio station logos  
  - `generic/` - Fallback placeholder logos
- ✅ Added `lib/broadcast-config.ts` for logo mappings
- ✅ Created comprehensive JSON config at `config/broadcast-logos.json`
- ✅ Added README files with logo guidelines

### 4. Features
- **TV Broadcasts**: FOX, TBS, ESPN, HBO Max, FS1, etc.
- **Radio Broadcasts**: ESPN Radio, WFAN, local stations, etc.
- **Smart Grouping**: Separates TV and Radio into distinct sections
- **Responsive Design**: 1-3 columns based on screen size
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows call sign if logo fails to load
- **Status Tracking**: Live/Off status, streaming availability, free games

### 5. Data Source
Uses MLB Stats API endpoint:
```
https://statsapi.mlb.com/api/v1/schedule?sportId=1&date=YYYY-MM-DD&hydrate=broadcasts
```

### 6. Directory Structure Created
```
public/
└── logos/
    └── broadcasts/
        ├── tv/           # TV network logos
        ├── radio/        # Radio station logos
        └── generic/      # Fallback icons
config/
└── broadcast-logos.json  # Complete configuration
lib/
└── broadcast-config.ts   # TypeScript mappings
```

## Next Steps
1. Add actual logo files to the directories
2. Test with live MLB games
3. Consider adding streaming links if available in API
4. Add filters for national vs local broadcasts

## Usage
The broadcast tab appears automatically for MLB games when broadcast data is available. The tab is hidden for NFL games as requested.
